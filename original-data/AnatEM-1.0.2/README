This package contains the data of the extended Anatomical Entity
Mention (AnatEM) corpus, version 1.0.2.

This README provides a brief overview of the package contents. See the
LICENSE file included in the package for the data license, the
manuscript referenced at the bottom of this file for an introduction
of the corpus, and the project homepage

    http://nactem.ac.uk/anatomytagger/

for more information.


CONTENTS

This package contains the following:

* README:                 this file
* LICENSE:                licenses of the texts and annotations
* standoff:               annotations in standoff format
* conll:                  annotations in CoNLL format
* nersuite:               annotations in NERsuite format
* splits:                 definitions of corpus document subsets
* scripts:                scripts for working with the corpus data

The directories standoff, conll and nersuite contain the corpus
documents in various formats (see below). Each contains the
subdirectories all, train, devel, and test, corresponding to all
documents, training set documents, etc.

The directory splits/ contains the following lists of documents:

* train-documents.list:   training subset
* devel-documents.list:   development subset
* test-documents.list:    test subset
* general-documents.list: general domain subset
* cancer-documents.list:  cancer domain subset

Note that train/devel/test and general/cancer constitute partitions of
all the documents, but e.g. test/general do not (the intersection of
test and general represents general-domain test documents, etc.)

The directory scripts/ contains the following scripts:

* evalbio.pl:             evaluate BIO sequence against gold
* evalso.py:              evaluate standoff data against gold
* partition-files.sh:     partition files based on list of names

partition-files.sh can be run e.g. as follows to create the train, devel,
test split in the directory standoff/:

    ./scripts/partition-files.sh standoff/all/ standoff/ splits/{train,devel,test}-documents.list

Run evalbio.pl or evalso.py with the -h argument for usage.

FORMAT

The corpus data is provided in the following formats.

CoNLL format

The data in the conll/ directory are provided in the simple
line-oriented, TAB-separated format used e.g. in CoNLL shared tasks
(see e.g. http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2002/ner/). Each line contains
two TAB-separated columns: the token text and the tag, for
example:

white   B-Multi-tissue_structure
matter  I-Multi-tissue_structure
of      O
rat     O
spinal  B-Organ
cord    I-Organ

Each tag consist of one of the letters B, I or O (for "begin", "in",
and "out"), and the type of the entity for the B and I tags.

NERsuite format

The data in the nersuite/ directory are provided in the variant of the
CoNLL format (see above) applied by the NERsuite toolkit. Each line
contains the following TAB-separated columns: tag, start and end
offsets, token text, lemma, POS tag, and chunk tag (the latter three
columns were generated using nersuite_gtagger). For example:

B-Multi-tissue_structure        579     584     white   white   JJ      I-NP
I-Multi-tissue_structure        585     591     matter  matter  NN      I-NP
O       592     594     of      of      IN      B-PP
O       595     598     rat     rat     NN      B-NP
B-Organ 599     605     spinal  spinal  JJ      I-NP
I-Organ 606     610     cord    cord    NN      I-NP

The tag and token text columns are identical to those in the
CoNLL-formatted data.

Standoff format

The data in the standoff/ directory are provided in the standoff
format used by the brat annotation tool (http://brat.nlplab.org/). For
details of the format, see the documentation page
http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html
