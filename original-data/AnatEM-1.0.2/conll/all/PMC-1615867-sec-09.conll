It	O
is	O

from	O
the	O
interviews	O

in	O

knowledge	O

This	O
study	O
also	O
points	O
out	O
that	O
certain	O

This	O

concluded	O
that	O
even	O
though	O
the	O
accessibility	O
of	O
Western	O
medicine	O
for	O
simple	O
and	O
complicated	O
diseases	O
is	O

in	O
the	O

Kancheepuram	O

is	O
still	O
continue	O
to	O
depend	O
on	O
medicinal	O
plants	O
,	O
at	O

for	O
the	O
treatment	O
of	O
some	O
simple	O

such	O

Well	O

have	O
good	O

with	O

and	O
this	O
would	O

the	O
quality	O
of	O
healthcare	O
delivery	O
.	O

The	O
present	O
-	O
day	O
traditional	O
healers	O
are	O
very	O
old	O
.	O

Due	O
to	O
lack	O
of	O
interest	O
among	O
the	O
younger	O
generation	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
their	O
tendency	O
to	O
migrate	O
to	O
cities	O
for	O
lucrative	O

,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
possibility	O
of	O
losing	O
this	O
wealth	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

It	O
thus	O
becomes	O
necessary	O
to	O

this	O
