OBJECTIVES	O
:	O
Recently	O

it	O
has	O
been	O
reported	O
that	O
expression	O
of	O
the	O
HRK	O

was	O
significantly	O
reduced	O
by	O
hypermethylation	O

Our	O
aim	O
is	O
to	O
verify	O
the	O
alterations	O
in	O
the	O

METHODS	O

We	O
analyzed	O
the	O

Hypermethylation	O
of	O
the	O
HRK	O

CONCLUSIONS	O
:	O
Our	O
findings	O
suggest	O
that	O
transcriptional	O
repression	O
of	O
HRK	O
is	O
caused	O
by	O
promoter	O
hypermethylation	O
in	O
PCNSL	B-Cancer

and	O
that	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
HRK	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O
methylation	O
profile	O
of	O
other	O
genes	O
is	O
a	O
potential	O
