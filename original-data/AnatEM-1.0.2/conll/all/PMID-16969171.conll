PURPOSE	O
OF	O
REVIEW	O
:	O

To	O
describe	O
recent	O
research	O
that	O
examines	O
family	O
factors	O
that	O
promote	O
or	O
derail	O
adherence	O
to	O
medical	O
regimens	O
for	O
children	O
with	O
chronic	O
health	O
conditions	O
,	O
primarily	O
asthma	O
,	O

and	O

From	O
the	O
past	O
2	O
years	O
,	O
eight	O
correlational	O

were	O

RECENT	O
FINDINGS	O
:	O

Findings	O
from	O
the	O
studies	O
suggest	O
that	O
team	O
-	O
based	O
management	O
strategies	O
and	O
cohesive	O
family	O
climate	O
promote	O
adherence	O
to	O
medical	O
treatments	O
over	O
time	O
.	O

Family	O
interactions	O
that	O
are	O
characterized	O
by	O
conflict	O
and	O
disengagement	O
tend	O
to	O
disrupt	O
adherence	O
and	O
inevitably	O
cause	O
a	O
decline	O
in	O
child	O
health	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
these	O
findings	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
moderated	O
by	O
child	O
age	O
in	O
that	O
poorer	O
adherence	O
often	O
occurs	O
when	O
a	O
child	O
reaches	O
adolescence	O
and	O
is	O
searching	O
for	O
greater	O
autonomy	O
.	O

SUMMARY	O
:	O

Future	O
research	O
should	O
consider	O
the	O
challenges	O
in	O
measuring	O
medical	O
adherence	O
in	O
the	O
family	O
context	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
incorporating	O
more	O
naturalistic	O

of	O
family	O
interactions	O
.	O

Randomized	O
controlled	O
trials	O
using	O
family	O

based	O
interventions	O
may	O
consider	O
focusing	O
on	O
medical	O

as	O
an	O
