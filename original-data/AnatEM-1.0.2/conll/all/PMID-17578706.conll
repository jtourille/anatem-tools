The	O
contribution	O
of	O
Harold	O
F	O
.	O
Dvorak	O
to	O
the	O
study	O
of	O
tumor	B-Cancer
angiogenesis	O
and	O
stroma	B-Tissue
generation	O
mechanisms	O
.	O

In	O
1983	O
,	O
Harold	O
Dvorak	O
and	O
his	O
colleagues	O
were	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
tumor	B-Cell
cells	I-Cell
secreted	O
vascular	O
permeability	O
factor	O
(	O
VPF	O
)	O
and	O
that	O
a	O
blocking	O
antibody	O
to	O
VPF	O
could	O
prevent	O
the	O
edema	B-Pathological_formation
and	O
fluid	B-Organism_substance
accumulation	O
that	O
is	O
characteristic	O
of	O
human	O
cancers	B-Cancer
.	O

In	O
1986	O
,	O
Dvorak	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
secreted	O
by	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
human	O
tumor	B-Cell
cell	I-Cell
lines	I-Cell
and	O
proposed	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
in	O
part	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
abnormal	O
vasculature	B-Multi-tissue_structure
seen	O
in	O
human	O
tumors	B-Cancer
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
other	O
investigators	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
capable	O
of	O
stimulating	O
endothelial	B-Cell
cell	I-Cell
growth	O
and	O
angiogenesis	O
.	O

These	O
fundamental	O
discoveries	O
led	O
to	O
additional	O
research	O
conducted	O
by	O
Napoleone	O
Ferrara	O
and	O
his	O
laboratory	O
,	O
confirming	O
the	O
cloning	O
of	O
VPF	O
and	O
renaming	O
the	O
protein	O
vascular	O
endothelial	O
growth	O
factor	O
(	O
VEGF	O
)	O
.	O

In	O
1986	O
,	O
Dvorak	O
proposed	O
that	O
by	O
secreting	O
VPF	O
,	O
tumors	B-Cancer
induce	O
angiogenesis	O
by	O
turning	O
on	O
the	O
wound	B-Pathological_formation
healing	O
response	O
.	O

He	O
noted	O
that	O
wounds	B-Pathological_formation
,	O
like	O
tumors	B-Cancer
,	O
secrete	O
VPF	O
,	O
causing	O
blood	B-Multi-tissue_structure
vessels	I-Multi-tissue_structure
to	O
leak	O
plasma	B-Organism_substance
fibrinogen	O
,	O
which	O
stimulates	O
blood	B-Multi-tissue_structure
vessel	I-Multi-tissue_structure
growth	O
and	O
provides	O
a	O
matrix	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
can	O
spread	O
.	O

Unlike	O
wounds	B-Pathological_formation
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
turn	O
off	O
VPF	O
production	O
after	O
healing	O
,	O
tumors	B-Cancer
did	O
not	O
turn	O
off	O
their	O
VPF	O
production	O
and	O
instead	O
continued	O
to	O
make	O
large	O
amounts	O
of	O
VPF	O
,	O
allowing	O
malignant	B-Cell
cells	I-Cell
to	O
continue	O
to	O
induce	O
new	O
blood	B-Multi-tissue_structure
vessels	I-Multi-tissue_structure
and	O
so	O
to	O
grow	O
and	O
spread	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
tumors	B-Cancer
behave	O
like	O
wounds	B-Pathological_formation
that	O
fail	O
to	O
heal	O
.	O

This	O
work	O
is	O
again	O
extremely	O
significant	O
for	O
patients	O
worldwide	O
,	O
as	O
Dvorak	O
'	O
s	O
scientific	O
research	O
is	O
leading	O
his	O
colleagues	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
examine	O
how	O
to	O
treat	O
a	O
tumor	B-Cancer
through	O
its	O
