BACKGROUND	O
:	O
We	O
suggest	O
that	O
surgical	O
extirpation	O
of	O
primary	B-Cancer
breast	I-Cancer
cancer	I-Cancer
among	O
other	O
effects	O
accelerates	O
relapse	O
for	O
some	O
premenopausal	O
node	B-Multi-tissue_structure
-	O
positive	O
patients	O
.	O

These	O
accelerated	O
relapses	O
occur	O
within	O
10	O
months	O
of	O
surgery	O
for	O
untreated	O
patients	O
.	O

The	O
mechanism	O
proposed	O
is	O
a	O
stimulation	O
of	O
angiogenesis	O
for	O
distant	B-Cancer
dormant	I-Cancer
micrometastases	I-Cancer

This	O
has	O
been	O
suggested	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
mechanisms	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O
mammography	O

women	O

We	O
could	O
imagine	O
that	O
it	O
also	O
plays	O
a	O
role	O
in	O
adjuvant	O
chemotherapy	O
effectiveness	O
since	O
,	O
perhaps	O
not	O

HYPOTHESIS	O
:	O
We	O
speculate	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
burst	O
of	O
angiogenesis	O
of	O
distant	B-Cancer
dormant	I-Cancer
micrometastases	I-Cancer
after	O

We	O
also	O
speculate	O
that	O
this	O
synchronizes	O
them	O
into	O
a	O
temporal	O
highly	O
chemosensitive	O
state	O
and	O
is	O
the	O
underlying	O
reason	O
why	O
adjuvant	O
chemotherapy	O
works	O
particularly	O
well	O
for	O
that	O
patient	O
category	O

Furthermore	O

this	O
may	O

why	O

more	O
