In	O
brief	O
,	O
3	O
patients	O
are	O
treated	O
at	O
a	O
starting	O
dose	O
which	O
is	O
typically	O
one	O
tenth	O
of	O
the	O
dose	O
that	O
is	O
lethal	O
to	O

in	O
preclinical	O
studies	O

If	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
3	O
patients	O
experiences	O
DLT	O

then	O
the	O
next	O
3	O
patients	O
will	O
be	O
treated	O
at	O
the	O
next	O

dose	O

If	O
DLT	O
is	O
observed	O
,	O
additional	O
patients	O
will	O
be	O
treated	O
at	O
the	O

level	O
to	O
determine	O
MTD	O
according	O
to	O
a	O
predetermined	O
schema	O

The	O
MTD	O
is	O
defined	O
as	O
the	O
highest	O

for	O
which	O
the	O

occurs	O
in	O

There	O
are	O
several	O
shortcomings	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O

Fibonacci	O
design	O

It	O
has	O
long	O
been	O
recognized	O
that	O
a	O
substantial	O
number	O
of	O
patients	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
at	O
subtherapeutic	O
doses	O

This	O
is	O
particularly	O
true	O
for	O
drugs	O
with	O
potential	O
anticancer	O
activity	O

Since	O
the	O
primary	O
purpose	O
of	O
phase	O
I	O
trials	O
is	O
to	O
determine	O
DLT	O
and	O
MTD	O
,	O
the	O
efficacy	O
of	O
the	O
drug	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
evident	O
for	O
certain	O
tumor	B-Cancer
types	O
as	O
there	O
are	O
only	O
a	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
patients	O
enrolled	O
into	O
the	O
trial	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
the	O
modified	O

Fibonacci	O
design	O
does	O
not	O
take	O
into	O
account	O
individual	O
variations	O
in	O

responses	O
due	O

In	O

since	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
limit	O
of	O
3	O

allowed	O
for	O

a	O

period	O

before	O

the	O
next	O

This	O

requirement	O
creates	O

Several	O
alternative	O

have	O
