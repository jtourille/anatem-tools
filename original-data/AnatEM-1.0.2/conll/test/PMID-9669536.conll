The	O
purpose	O
of	O
this	O
study	O
was	O
to	O
compare	O
persons	O
with	O
antisocial	O
personality	O

(	O

)	O
with	O
those	O
who	O
meet	O
the	O

criteria	O
for	O
ASP	O
but	O
fail	O
to	O
meet	O
the	O
criteria	O
for	O
childhood	O
conduct	O

Sociodemographic	O

medical	O
history	O
,	O
and	O
psychiatric	O
symptoms	O
exhibited	O
during	O
a	O
recent	O
hospital	O
admission	O
were	O
compared	O
in	O
the	O
two	O
groups	O
by	O
chart	O
review	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
groups	O
were	O
virtually	O
indistinguishable	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
patients	O
without	O
childhood	O
conduct	O
disorder	O
were	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O
smoke	O
or	O
consume	O
alcohol	O
,	O
were	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O
have	O
spent	O
time	O
in	O

We	O
conclude	O
that	O
persons	O

not	O
the	O
